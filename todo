lin_alg:
	add -D_OPTIMIZED conditional compilation to all files (elim bounds checks)
	
element:
	add vector element factory. Stores one Element* for each element,
	so values don't have to be recomputed between timesteps (at expense of storage)

output:
	add method to handle time-varying output. (write lots of files, keep track of names,
	write to .pvd file at end?)
