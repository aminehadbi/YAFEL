lin_alg:
	start incorporating C++11 move semantics. Should cut memory allocations in half.

element:
	-add vector element factory. Stores one Element* for each element,
	 so values don't have to be recomputed between timesteps (at expense of storage)
	-Will also make assembly parallelization possible
mesh:
	Mesh generation functions. make {1,2,3}-D rectillinear meshes without gmsh.
	Include options to have boundary elements included to facilitate BC application.
